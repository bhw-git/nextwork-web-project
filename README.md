# NextWork DevOps Challenge ‚Äì AWS Project

This repository contains my implementation of the **NextWork 7-Day DevOps Challenge**, where I built, packaged, and deployed a Java web application using AWS services such as **CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, and EC2**.

The goal of this project is to practice **end-to-end DevOps workflows** on AWS and gain real-world experience in building CI/CD pipelines.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Application**: Basic Java Web Application (WAR/JAR)
- **Cloud Provider**: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **CI/CD Tools**: CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline
- **Compute**: EC2
- **Storage**: S3 for artifacts and packaged .war file
- **Version Control**: GitHub (integrated via CodeStar Connections)

| File / Folder         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pom.xml`             | Maven build configuration file                                              |
| `buildspec.yml`       | Instructions for CodeBuild (compiling + packaging app)                      |
| `appspec.yml`         | CodeDeploy manifest for deployment on EC2                                   |
| `scripts/`            | Lifecycle scripts (e.g., start, stop, restart app)                          |
| `src/`                | Java source code of the application                                         |
| `target/`             | Build output (JAR/WAR files generated by Maven)                             |
| `README.md`           | Project documentation (this file)                                           |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Source Stage**  
   - Code is stored on GitHub.  
   - CodePipeline pulls the latest code via CodeStar Connections.  

2. **Build Stage**  
   - CodeBuild compiles the Java app using Maven (`mvn clean package`).  
   - Artifact is stored in S3 bucket.  

3. **Deploy Stage**  
   - CodeDeploy fetches the artifact from S3.  
   - Installs on EC2 instance(s) using lifecycle hooks in `appspec.yml`.  
   - EC2 runs the application after deployment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- AWS Account with permissions for EC2, S3, IAM, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline  
- IAM Roles:  
  - **CodeBuild role** (S3 + CodeDeploy access)  
  - **CodeDeploy role** (EC2 + S3 access)  
  - **EC2 role** (CodeDeploy agent access)  
- Java 8 (Corretto 8 in CodeBuild)  
- Maven

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhw-git/nextwork-web-project.git
   cd <your-repo>
2. Monitor Deployment - via CodeDeploy console or CLI:
   ```bash
   aws deploy list-deployments --application-name <AppName>
3. Final build artifact is created in:
   ```bash
   target/<project-name>.war
  - This artifact is uploaded to S3 and deployed to EC2.
